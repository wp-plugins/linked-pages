== Description ==

The Linked Pages plugin allows links between posts to be created using customisable page pickers and then displayed using the built in widget.

Making use of custom post types, you can now easily create collections of pages and include structure.  For example, if your site is about football, you could implement two custom post types.  Football clubs and Players.  Using the provided tools, you can link players to their club in seconds and display the clubs current list of players.

* Minor change to correct the missing screenshots

= 0.2.1 =
* Original Release
